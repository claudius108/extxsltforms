exsltforms contains extension actions, elements and widgets that are not included into the XForms 1.1 specification.

A. Installation of eXSLTForms:
Copy the exsltforms files within an folder called "exsltforms" and set the path to this folder in the file $exsltforms_HOME/config/exsltforms-config.xml
(the value of 'exsltforms-base-uri' element).
Check unit tests for examples of usage.
By using the XSLTForms library bundled with exsltforms, all is included and working just by changing the path to $exsltforms_HOME/tests/resources/xsltforms/xsltforms.xsl
in your files. If you want to use XSLTforms library that is installed somewhere else, replace the xsltforms.xsl and config.xsl file of that library with the ones from
$exsltforms_HOME/tests/resources/xsltforms.
As to rich text editors and other widgets, except Xinha, there is no need to install them, unless you want. 


B. Installation of Xinha Editor:
a. Install Xinha folder (version 0.96.1) to the desired location.
b. Set the URI to editor's folder in $exsltforms_HOME/config/rte-config.xml file.
