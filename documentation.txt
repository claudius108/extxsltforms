eXSLTForms contains extension actions and elements that are not included into the XForms 1.1 specification.

Notes:
1. eXSLTForms namespace is xmlns:exfk="http://kuberam.ro/exsltforms".
2. Integration of the below mentioned web rich text editors allows user to update the @ref node of textarea element with editor's content and to update the
editor's content with the value of the @ref node of textarea element.

Extensions
1. The transform action
Performs a xsl transformation of a nodeset (part of a data instance), by using an external XSL stylesheet, and inserts the resulting nodeset in a data instance,
replacing the target nodeset.

Common Attributes: none

Special Attributes:
type:
An attribute containing the type of transformation. Possible values: XSLT, XQuery, XProc.
origin
An attribute containing an XPath expression that selects the set of nodes on which this element operates the XSL transformation.
transformer
An attribute containing the path to the external XSL stylesheet.
ref
An attribute containing an XPath expression that selects the set of nodes being replaced by the result of the XSL transformation.
param
An attribute containing an XPath expression that selects the set of nodes being used as parameters for the XSL transformation.
The syntax for this set of nodes should be as follows:
	<parameters>
		<param name="param1" value="value1"/>
		<param name="param2" value="value2"/>
	</parameters>

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/transform-action-01.xml.


2. The replace action
Performs a replacing action of a target nodeset (part of a data instance), by an origin nodeset (part of a data instance).
This is useful to have a simpler syntax for http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#data-mutation-patterns-replace-element.

Common Attributes: none

Special Attributes:
origin
An attribute containing an XPath expression that selects the set of nodes to be cloned by the replace action.
target
An attribute containing an XPath expression that selects the set of nodes being replaced by the replace action.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/replace-action-01.xml.


3. The @appearance = "exfk:CKEditor" of textarea element, which allows the integration of CKEditor (http://ckeditor.com) web based
rich text editor into XSLTForms.
In case or @incremental="true", the content will be saved from time to time, according to changes.
In case of @incremental="false" or @incremental misssing, the content will be saved when the user exit the editor.

Extension child elements:
rteOptions (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the configuration options as a string.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/ckeditor-rich-text-editor-01.xml.

Note: In case one needs standard options of the editor, use this syntax for rteOptions element: <exfk:rteOptions>{}</exfk:rteOptions>.


4. The @appearance = "exfk:EditArea" of textarea element, which allows the integration of EditArea (http://cdolivet.com) code editor
into XSLTForms.
The content has to be saved by pressing the "Save" button.

Extension child elements:
rteOptions (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the configuration options as a string.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/editarea-code-editor-01.xml.

Note: In case one needs standard options of the editor, use this syntax for rteOptions element: <exfk:rteOptions>{}</exfk:rteOptions>.


5. The @appearance = "exfk:YUIEditor" of textarea element, which allows the integration of YUI Editor or SimpleEditor
 (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) web based rich text editor into XSLTForms.
In case or @incremental="true", the content will be saved from time to time, according to changes.
In case of @incremental="false" or @incremental misssing, the content will be saved when the user exit the editor.

Extension child elements:
rteOptions (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the configuration options as a string.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/yui-rich-text-editors-01.xml.

Notes:
a. The easiest way for styling the editor is to use @class="yui-skin-sam" for body element or for a div element wrapping the respective
textarea.
b. In case you need YUI Editor instead of SimpleEditor, make this modification in exfk:rteOptions, YUIeditorType.
c. In case one needs standard options of the editor, use this syntax for rteOptions element: <exfk:rteOptions>{}</exfk:rteOptions>.


6. The @appearance = "exfk:DojoEditor" of textarea element, which allows the integration of Dojo Editor 
(http://www.dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/Editor.html) web based rich text editor into XSLTForms.
In case or @incremental="true", the content will be saved from time to time, according to changes.
In case of @incremental="false" or @incremental misssing, the content will be saved when the user exit the editor.

Extension child elements:
rteOptions (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the configuration options as a string.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/dojo-rich-text-editor-01.xml.

Notes:
a. In order to style the editor, one should add <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../utils/dojo/dijit/themes/tundra/tundra.css"/> 
to head element of page and @class="tundra" to body element of page.
b. In case one needs standard options of the editor, use this syntax for rteOptions element: <exfk:rteOptions>{}</exfk:rteOptions>.


7. The @appearance = "exfk:Xinha" of textarea element, which allows the integration of Xinha (http://xinha.org) web based rich text
editor into XSLTForms.
In case or @incremental="true", the content will be saved from time to time, according to changes.
In case of @incremental="false" or @incremental misssing, the content will be saved when the user exit the editor.

Extension child elements:
rteOptions (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the configuration options as a string.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/xinha-rich-text-editor-01.xml.


8. The @appearance = "exfk:YUI2-DataTable" of HTML table element, which allows the integration of YUI2 DataTable
widget (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/) into XSLTForms.

Extension child elements:
exfk:formatters (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the data formatters to be used in datatable.
exfk:paginator (within the namespace exkf, see note on top of page)
This extension child element allows user to specify the attributes of datatable's paginator.

Example: see $exsltforms_HOME/tests/unit-tests/yui-rich-text-editors-01.xml.
